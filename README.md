# Naive-Bayesian-Classifier

A program to construct a naïve bayesian classifier on the breast cancer wisconsin dataset.  
The dataset can be found in sklearn.datasets package(sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer),  
or you can find the dataset on [UCI: Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)).  
This program use the stratified 10-fold cross-validation (outer cross-validation) for  
estimating the accuracy of the classifier.

This is an assignment on NTOU Machine Learning 2017 Spring.  
This repository as a **note** help me to find the code in the future! 😀
